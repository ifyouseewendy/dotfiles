* neo-tree.nvim only shows tofu (box glyph). It seems to be a system issue that I cannot even see the unicode in my browser
  - Fixed by installing Nerd Fonts and get it used as fixed-width fonts in Chrome and non-ascii fonts in iTerm
* vim-expand-region is not compatible with nvim https://github.com/terryma/vim-expand-region/issues/23
